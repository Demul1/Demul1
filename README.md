## About Me

I am a developer, who has a lot of experience in the cryptocurrency area as well as in game development. Some of my other hobbies include Tennis, although I can't currently play it due to being crippled. Some of the langauges I know include Solidity, Javascript, Python, C#, and HTML/CSS (if you count those). I have experience using Unity and Unreal Engine for game development.
